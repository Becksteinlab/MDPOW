  (#8)
* boxtype and minimum distance (#30) can be set in runinput.yml and are

* fixed: using new travis CI settings so CI tests stop failing (#101)
* fixed: GROMACS 2020 fails with "Inconsistency in user input:
  Could not do a restart with appending because the checkpoint file was not
  found. Either supply the name of the right checkpoint file or do not use
  -append": mdpow.run.runMD_or_exit() does not anymore add -append to GROMACS
  invocation (#128)
* Configuration setting mdrun.maxthreads now also applies to energy
  minimization with mdpow-equilibrium.py/mdpow.run() (#119)
* supported forcefield options in scripts (#123)
* supported multiple edr files input in fep.py (#132)
* supported alchemlyb estimators in analysis functions and scripts

* removed unused analysis.py and analysis/thermodynamics.py
* supported water models: TIP4P, TIP3P, TIP5P, SPC, SPC/E, and
  new: M24 (modified TIP3P, #46)

  (#78)
* EDR files are now output by default instead of XVG (#75)
* fep.Gsolv.analyze() automatically converts EDR to XVG.bz2 if
