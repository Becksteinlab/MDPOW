* fixed: using new travis CI settings so CI tests stop failing (#101)
* fixed: GROMACS 2020 fails with "Inconsistency in user input:
  Could not do a restart with appending because the checkpoint file was not

  -append": mdpow.run.runMD_or_exit() does not anymore add -append to GROMACS
  invocation (#128)
* Configuration setting mdrun.maxthreads now also applies to energy
  minimization with mdpow-equilibrium.py/mdpow.run() (#119)
* supported forcefield options in scripts (#123)
* supported multiple edr files input in fep.py (#132)
* supported alchemlyb estimators in analysis functions and scripts

  (#78)
* EDR files are now output by default instead of XVG (#75)
* fep.Gsolv.analyze() automatically converts EDR to XVG.bz2 if
