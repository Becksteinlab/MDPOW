.. _mdpow-scripts-label:

The ``mdpow-*`` scripts
=======================

A number of python scripts are installed together with the
:mod:`mdpow` package. They simplify some common tasks (especially at
the analysis stage) but they make some assumptions about directory
layout and filenames. If one uses defaults for all directory and
filename options then it should "just work".

In particular, a directory hierarchy such as the following is
assumed::

  moleculename/
       water.simulation
       octanol.simulation
       Equilibrium/
             water/
             octanol/
       FEP/
             water/
                   Ghyd.fep
                   Coulomb/
                   VDW/
             octanol/
                   Goct.fep
                   Coulomb/
                   VDW/

*moleculename* is, for instance, "benzene" or "amantadine"; in the run
input file (see `Equilibrium simulations`_) is the value of the
variable ``name`` in the ``[setup]`` section.


.. _mdpow-equilibrium-label:

Equilibrium simulations
-----------------------

The :program:`mdpow-equilibrium` script

* sets up equilibrium MD simulations for the solvents (e.g., *water* or
  *octanol*)
* runs **energy minimization**, **MD_relaxed**, and **MD_NPT**
  protocols; the user can choose if she wants to launch
  :program:`mdrun` herself (e.g. on a cluster) or let the script do it
  locally on the workstation

The script runs essentially the same steps as described in the tutorial
:ref:`example_octanol-label` but it gathers all required parameters from a run
input file and it allows one to stop and continue and the protocol
transparently.

It requires as at least Gromacs 4.6.5 ready to run (check that all commands can
be found). The required **input** is

  1. a run configuration file (*runinput.yml*);
  2. a structure file (PDB or GRO) for the compound
  3. a Gromacs ITP file for the compound (OPLS/AA force field)

A template *RUNFILE* can be generated with :option:`mdpow-get-runinput
runinput.yml`, which will copy the default run input file bundled with
MDPOW and put it in the current directory under the name
``runinput.yml``.

For an example of a *RUNFILE* see :download:`benzene.yml
<../../examples/benzene.yml>`. It is recommended to use absolute paths
to file names. The run input file uses `YAML`_ syntax (and is parsed
by :mod:`yaml`).

.. _YAML: http://yaml.org/

.. Note:: It is recommended to enclose all strings in the input file
          in quotes, especially if they can be interpreted as
          numbers. For example, a name "005" would be interpreted as
          the number 5 unless explicitly quoted.

The script keeps track of the stages of the simulation protocol and allows the
user to **restart from the last completed stage**. For instance, one can use the
script to set up a simulation, then run the simulation on a cluster, transfer
back the generated files, and start :program:`mdpow-equilibrium` again with the
exact same input to finish the protocol. Since Gromacs 4.5 it is also possible
to interrupt a running :program:`mdrun` process (e.g. with :kbd:`Control-c`)
and then resume the simulation at the last saved trajectory checkpoint by
running :program:`mdpow-equilibrium` again.

If in doubt, just try running :program:`mdpow-equilibrium` running again and
let it figure out the best course of action. Look at the log file to see what
has been done. Lines reading "Fast forwarding: *stage*" indicate that results
from *stage* are available.

Usage of the command:

   .. program:: mdpow-equilibrium

   :program:`mdpow-equilibrium` [options] *RUNFILE*

   Set up (and possibly run) the equilibration equilibrium simulation for one
   compound and one solvent. All parameters except the solvent are specified in
   the *RUNFILE*.

   Options:

   .. cmdoption:: -h, --help

      show this help message and exit

   .. cmdoption:: -S <NAME>, --solvent=<NAME>

      solvent ``<NAME>`` for compound, can be 'water', 'octanol', 'cyclohexane' [water]

   .. cmdoption:: -d <DIRECTORY>, --dirname=<DIRECTORY>

      generate files and directories in ``<DIRECTORY>``, which is created if it does not
      already exist. The default is to use the molecule *name* from the run input
      file.


.. _mdpow-fep-label:

FEP simulations
--------------- 

The :program:`mdpow-fep` script sets up (and can also run) the free energy
perturbation calculations for one compound and one solvent. It uses the results
from :ref:`mdpow-equilibrium <mdpow-equilibrium-label>` together with the run
input file.

You will require:

1. at least Gromacs 4.0.5 ready to run (check that all commands can
   be found)
2. the results from a previous complete run of :program:`mdpow-equilibrium`


Usage of the command:

   .. program:: mdpow-fep

   :program:`mdpow-fep`  [options] *RUNFILE*

   Options:

   .. cmdoption:: -h, --help

      show this help message and exit

   .. cmdoption:: --get-template        

      generate a template *RUNFILE* and exit

   .. cmdoption:: -S <NAME>, --solvent=<NAME>

      solvent ``<NAME>`` for compound, can be 'water' or 'octanol' [water]

   .. cmdoption:: -d <DIRECTORY>, --dirname=<DIRECTORY>

      generate files and directories in ``<DIRECTORY>``, which is created if it
      does not already exist. The default is to use the molecule *name* from the run
      input file.



.. _mdpow-pow-label:

Running analysis
----------------

Solvation free energy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :program:`mdpow-solvationenergy` calculatest the solvation free
energy. It

* collects data from FEP simulations (converting EDR files to XVG.bz2
  when necessary)
* calculates desolvation free energies for *solvent* --> vacuum via
  thermodynamic integration (TI)  
* plots dV/dlambda graphs
* appends results to ``energies.txt`` (when the
  default names are chosen), see :ref:`mdpow-pow-outputformat-label`.


Usage of the command:

   .. program:: mdpow-solvationenergy

      :program:`mdpow-solvationenergy` [options] DIRECTORY [DIRECTORY ...]
            
      Run the free energy analysis for a solvent in ``<DIRECTORY>/FEP`` and
      return ``DeltaG``.

      ``DIRECTORY`` should contain all the files resulting from running
      ``mdpow.fep.Ghyd.setup()`` (or the corresponding ``Goct.setup()`` or
      ``Gcyclohexane.setup()`` and the results of the MD FEP simulations. It
      relies on the canonical naming scheme (basically: just use the defaults
      as in the tutorial).

      The dV/dlambda plots can be produced automatically (``--plot=auto``). If
      multiple ``DIRECTORY`` arguments are provided then one has to choose the
      "auto" option (or ``None``).

      The total solvation free energy is calculated as

           DeltaG* = -(DeltaG_coul + DeltaG_vdw)

      Note that the standard state refers to the "Ben-Naim" standard state of
      transferring 1 M of compound in the gas phase to 1 M in the aqueous
      phase.

      Results are *appended* to a data file with **Output file format**::

		.                 ---------- kJ/mol ---
		molecule solvent  DeltaG*  coulomb  vdw

      All observables are quoted with an error estimate, which is derived
      from the correlation time and error propagation through Simpson's rule
      (see :meth:`mdpow.fep.Gsolv`). It ultimately comes from the error on
      <dV/dlambda>, which is estimated as the error to determine the
      average.

      :molecule:
	  molecule name as used in the itp
      :DeltaG*:
	  solvation free energy vacuum --> solvent, in kJ/mol
      :coulomb:
	  discharging contribution to the DeltaG*
      :vdw:
	  decoupling contribution to the DeltaG*
      :directory:
	  folder in which the simulations were stored


   Options:

   .. cmdoption:: -h, --help

      show this help message and exit

   .. cmdoption:: -S <NAME>, --solvent=<NAME>
   
      solvent NAME for compound, 'water', 'octanol', or 'cyclohexane' [water]

   .. cmdoption:: -p <FILE>, --plotfile=<FILE>

      plot dV/dlambda to :file:`{FILE}`; use png or pdf suffix to determine the
      file type. 'auto' generates a pdf file :file:`{DIRECTORY}/dVdl.pdf` and
      'None' disables it [auto]

   .. cmdoption:: -e <FILE>, --energies=<FILE>

      append solvation free energies to ``<FILE>`` [:file:`energies.txt`]

   .. cmdoption:: -s <N>, --stride=<N>

      Use every N-th datapoint from the original dV/dlambda data. Using a
      number larger than 1 can significantly reduce memory usage with little
      impact on the precision of the final output. [10]

   .. cmdoption:: --force

      force rereading all data [False]

   .. cmdoption:: --ignore-corrupted

      skip lines in the md.xvg files that cannot be parsed, perhaps because to an
      intermittent file system problem. In order to salvage the existing data,
      this option is provided for diagnostic purposes.  [False]

      .. Warning:: Only use this option with care; skipped lines can indicate that
	 other parts of the file have been corrupted but still pass the line
	 corruption test. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. 

      It is recommended to simply rerun the affected simulation(s).


Partition coefficients
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :program:`mdpow-pow` script 

* collects data from FEP simulations
* calculates desolvation free energies for octanol --> vacuum and
  water --> vacuum via thermodynamic integration (TI)
* calculates transfer free energy water --> octanol
* calculates |logPow|
* plots dV/dlambda graphs
* appends results to ``pow.txt`` and ``energies.txt`` (when the
  default names are chosen), see :ref:`mdpow-pow-outputformat-label`.

Usage of the command:

   .. program:: mdpow-pow

   :program:`mdpow-pow` [options] *DIRECTORY* [*DIRECTORY* ...]

   Run the free energy analysis for water and octanol in *DIRECTORY*/FEP and
   return the octanol-water partition coefficient |logPow|.

   *DIRECTORY* should contain all the files resulting from running
   :meth:`mdpow.fep.Goct.setup` and :meth:`mdpow.fep.Goct.setup` and the results
   of the MD FEP simulations. It relies on the canonical naming scheme (basically:
   just use the defaults as in the tutorial).

   The dV/dlambda plots can be produced automatically (:option:`mdpow-pow
   -p` auto). If multiple *DIRECTORY* arguments are provided then one has to
   choose the auto option (or ``None``).

   Options:

   .. cmdoption:: -h, --help

      show this help message and exit

   .. cmdoption:: -p <FILE>, --plotfile=<FILE>

      plot dV/dlambda to :file:`{FILE}`; use png or pdf suffix to determine the
      file type. 'auto' generates a pdf file :file:`{DIRECTORY}/dVdl.pdf` and
      'None' disables it [auto]

   .. cmdoption:: -o <FILE>, --outfile=<FILE>

      append one-line results summary to ``<FILE>`` [:file:`pow.txt`]

   .. cmdoption:: -e <FILE>, --energies=<FILE>

      append solvation free energies to ``<FILE>`` [:file:`energies.txt`]

   .. cmdoption:: --force

      force rereading all data [False]

   .. cmdoption:: --ignore-corrupted

      skip lines in the md.xvg files that cannot be parsed, perhaps because to an
      intermittent file system problem. In order to salvage the existing data,
      this option is provided for diagnostic purposes.  [False]

      .. Warning:: Only use this option with care; skipped lines can indicate that
	 other parts of the file have been corrupted but still pass the line
	 corruption test. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. 

      It is recommended to simply rerun the affected simulation(s).

House-keeping scripts
---------------------

A number of scripts are provided to complete simple tasks; they can be
used to check that all required files are present or they can help in
fixing small problems without one having to write Python code to do
this oneself (e.g. by manipulating the checlpoint files). They
generally make the same assumptions about file system layout as the
other mdpow scripts.


Checking if the simulation is complete
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run :program:`mdpow-check` in order to check if all necessary files
are available.

Usage of the command:

   .. program:: mdpow-check

   :program:`mdpow-check` [options] *DIRECTORY* [*DIRECTORY* ...]

   Check status of the progress of the project in *DIRECTORY*.

   Output is only written to the status file (:file:`status.txt`). A quick way to find
   problems is to do a ::

	cat status.txt | gawk -F '|' '$2 !~ /OK/ {print $0}'

   Options:

   .. cmdoption:: -h, --help

      show this help message and exit

   .. cmdoption:: -o <FILE>, --outfile=<FILE>

      write status results to :file:`{FILE}` [:file:`status.txt`]


Changing paths in :file:`water.simulation` and :file:`octanol.simulation`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It can become necessary to recreate the :file:`{solvent}.simulation`
status/checkpoint files in order to change paths, e.g. when one moved
the directories or transferred all files to a different file system.

Typically, one would execute the :program:`mdpow-rebuild-simulation` command
in the parent directory of *moleculename*.

Usage of the command:

   .. program:: mdpow-rebuild-simulation

   :program:`mdpow-rebuild-simulation` [options] *DIRECTORY* [*DIRECTORY* ...]

   Re-create the ``water.simulation`` or ``octanol.simulation`` file with
   adjusted paths (now rooted at *DIRECTORY*).

   Options:

   .. cmdoption:: -h, --help

      show this help message and exit

   .. cmdoption:: --solvent=<NAME>

      rebuild file for 'water', 'octanol', or 'all' [all]


Re-building :file:`Ghyd.fep` and :file:`Goct.fep`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It can become necessary to recreate the :file:`{name}.fep` status/checkpoint
files (e.g. if the files became corrupted due to a software error or in order
to change paths).

Typically, one would execute the :program:`mdpow-rebuild-fep` command
in the parent directory of *moleculename*.

Usage of the command:

   .. program:: mdpow-rebuild-fep

   :program:`mdpow-rebuild-fep` [options] *DIRECTORY* [*DIRECTORY* ...]

   Re-create the :file:`Goct.fep` or :file:`Ghyd.fep` file using the appropriate
   equilibrium simulation file under *DIRECTORY*/FEP.

   This should only be necessary when the fep file was destroyed due to a software
   error or when the files are transferred to a different file system and some of
   the paths stored in the :file:`{name}.fep` files have to be changed.

   Options:

   .. cmdoption:: -h, --help

      show this help message and exit

   .. cmdoption:: --solvent=<NAME>

      rebuild fep for 'water', 'octanol', or 'all' [all]

   .. cmdoption:: --setup=<LIST>

      Re-generate queuing system scripts with appropriate paths: runs
      :meth:`fep.Gsolv.setup` with argument `qscript=[LIST]` after
      fixing Gsolv.

      ``LIST`` should contain a comma-separated list of queing system
      templates. For example:
      ``'icsn_8pd.sge,icsn_2pd.sge,local.sh'``. It is an error if
      ``--setup`` is set without a ``LIST``.
