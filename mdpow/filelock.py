On occasion, one requires the need to lock a file. Now, this is relatively easy
if you're targeting a specific platform because there is often a function in
the library to do it for you. But what if you want to target a larger set of
platforms? The following is a solution I wrote up today. It's lockfile creation
is an atomic operation and thus doesn't suffer from any race conditions. It
should work in both Windows and Unix environments.

The above class is best used in a context manager fashion through the with statement like in the example below::

  with FileLock("test.txt", timeout=2) as lock:
      print("Lock acquired.")
      # Do something with the locked file

The largest downside of this is that the directory the file is located in must
be writable. I hope this code helps you. Of course, if you have a better
recipe, please share it in the comments. ;)
