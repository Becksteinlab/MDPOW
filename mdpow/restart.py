:mod:`mdpow.restart` --- Restarting and checkpointing
=====================================================

The module provides classes and functions to keep track of which stages of a
simulation protocol have been completed. It uses a :class:`Journal` class for
the book-keeping. Together with saving the current state of a protocol to a
checkpoint file (using :meth:`Journalled.save`) it is possible to implement
restartable simulation protocols (for example :program:`mdpow-equilibrium`).

    Transaction blocks have to be bracketed by calls to :meth:`~Journal.start`
    and :meth:`~Journal.completed`. If a block is started before completion, a
    :exc:`JournalSequenceError` will be raised.

    Other methods such as :meth:`~Journal.has_completed` and
    :meth:`~Journal.has_not_completed` can be used to query the status. The
    attribute :attr:`~Journal.incomplete` flags the state of the current stage
    (:attr:`~Journal.current`).

    All completed stages are recorded in the attribute
    :attr:`~Journal.history`.

    The current (incomplete) stage can be reset to its initial state with
    :meth:`Journal.clear`.

      J = Journal(['pre', 'main', 'post'])
      J.start('pre')
